# Capgemini Cloud Native Challenges
Challenges for cloud-native development

# Introduction
This repository contains a series of assignments that will test your Azure skills. The assignments are hands-on and will not focus on explaining all the details. We will give you guidance to find answers through links with relevant learnings and documentation.

# Goals
Our goal is to give everybody who participates a structured way to learn about the concepts that are involved when building out cloud-native solutions. You will get hands-on experience in building, deploying and maintaining applications that are cloud based from the start. This knowledge and experience will be of great value for every developer that works on cloud solutions for clients.

# Prerequisites
The only prerequisite for doing the assignments is that you have an **MSDN subscription**. This is because you will be deploying to Azure. Everyone in the Microsoft Cluster should already have an MSDN subscription, which comes with 50USD of monthly credit which you can spend on Azure resources.

# Assignments
The assignments are divided in three levels:
1.	**Beginner**. The goal here is that you can make it work.
2.	**Intermediate**. The goal here is that you can automate certain parts of the development process.
3.	**Expert**. The goal here is that you build applications following best practices. You should master certain components and become a subject matter expert in it.
